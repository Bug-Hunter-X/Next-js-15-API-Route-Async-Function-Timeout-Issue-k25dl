# Next.js 15 API Route Async Function Timeout Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where an API route with an asynchronous function fails to return data correctly if the asynchronous operation takes longer than the request timeout.  The issue is related to how Next.js 15 handles asynchronous operations within API routes.

## Bug

The `pages/api/data.js` file contains an API route that simulates an asynchronous operation using `setTimeout`. If the timeout is set to a value greater than the request timeout (which is typically around 30 seconds), the request will fail without any clear indication in the console. The solution explores ways to mitigate this issue, using techniques that account for timeout handling in the async operation.

## Solution

The `pages/api/dataSolution.js` demonstrates a solution which uses a `AbortController` to gracefully manage potential timeouts and provide more useful error messages back to the client, improving the user experience.
